Welcome to the **HR Data Analysis** project! This is a powerful combination of **MSSQL** for data processing and **PowerBI** for visualizing the key insights. If you're interested in how SQL meets stunning visual analytics, you're in the right place! 🎯

## 📊 Project Overview

This project dives into the company's HR data, helping uncover trends and insights that matter. We cleaned the data, explored relationships, and created eye-catching visualizations to present a comprehensive analysis.

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- **MSSQL** for data cleaning, transformation, and querying.
- **PowerBI** for data visualization and interactive dashboards.

The original HR data file can be found [here](https://github.com/Miinhaz/MS-SQL-POWERBI-PROJECT/blob/main/HR%20Data.csv), and all the **SQL codes** used for data processing are available [here](https://github.com/Miinhaz/MS-SQL-POWERBI-PROJECT/blob/main/Project.sql).

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Cleaning with MSSQL**
   - Standardized `termdate` format to `yyyy-MM-dd` 📅.
   - Created new columns for **employee age** and cleaned termination dates 🧹.
   - Performed **age group distribution**, **gender analysis**, **turnover rates**, and **tenure analysis** 🧑‍💻.

### 2. **Key SQL Queries:**
   - **Age Distribution**: Grouped employees into age ranges: 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, and 50+ 🎂.
   - **Gender Breakdown**: Showed gender distribution across departments 🧑‍🤝‍🧑.
   - **Turnover Rates**: Identified departments with the highest turnover, such as **auditing** and **legal** 💼.
   - **Tenure and Race**: Explored race distribution and average tenure by department 🌍.

### 3. **PowerBI Visualization**

After the data was cleaned in MSSQL, it was loaded into PowerBI for further transformation and visualization. Here's what the dashboard reveals:

#### 🔑 Key Insights from PowerBI:

- **Age Group Distribution**:
  - Most employees are in the 31-40 and 41-50 age ranges. 👨‍💼👩‍💼

- **Turnover Rates**:
  - Departments like **auditing** and **legal** face the highest turnover rates (up to 18%). ⚠️

- **Hire Percentage Change**:
  - Hiring has seen a **massive increase** over the years, with a peak of **96% growth in 2020**. 📈

- **Gender Distribution**:
  - A nearly balanced split between **male (9.3K)** and **female (8.5K)** employees. There's a slight representation of **non-conforming** employees. 👫
